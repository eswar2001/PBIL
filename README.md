## PBIL algorithm

PBIL can use either positive learning or negative learning to update probability vector. In positive learning the probability vector is moved towards the best solution vector and in negative learning the probability vector moves away from the worst solution vector. Typical value of learning rate lies between 0.1 and 0.4. The mutation probability is low as too high mutation rate prevents population to converge to any optimum solution
